# proc-linalg
Solves a basic linear equation for a variable, given a `syn::ExprClosure`, for use within a rust procedural macro.

The intent of this crate is to allow a procedural macro to solve a linear equation using the basic mathematical operators (add, subtract, divide multiply).

For example, if passed a `syn::ExprClosure` with a mathematical equation `y = 5*x + 2`, it will return the equation `x = (y - 2)/5`.

# Example

If a theoretical crate had a proc-macro `Inverter` with an argument `invert`, it could use this crate to invert a closure:

```rust
#[derive(Inverter)]
#[invert("|| 5 * x + 2")]
struct Invertable;
```

It could produce:

```rust
impl Invertable {
    fn calculate(value: usize) -> usize {
        // This next line is generated by this crate.
        let closure = |v| (v-2)/5;
        // The other code is generated by the procedural macro
        closure(value)
    }
}
```

The code to produce this closure is shown in the [usage](#Usage) section below.

# Usage

Within the procedural macro, first build a `syn::ExprClosure`. Then, build a `Variables` struct. Then ask the Variables struct to build an inverted closure:

```rust
use quote::format_ident;
use proc_linalg::Variables;

let closure: ExprClosure = syn::parse_quote!( || 5 * x + 2 );
let mut eq = Variables::new(format_ident!("x"), format_ident!("y"));
let solved_closure = eq.solve(closure);
```

An example of a simple implementation can be found in the [proc-linalg-derive](./proc-linalg-derive/) folder.
